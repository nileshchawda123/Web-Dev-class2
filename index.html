            The stage is set for the T20 World Cup 2024 as the USA is all set to co-host the tournament alongside the West Indies. The mega ICC event is going to be extremely crucial to create massive awareness about the sport in the USA where basketball and baseball are enjoyed by a wider audience. Big players like Virat Kohli will also play a big role in promoting the game in the states as cricket will also be part of the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.

            “Honestly, I never thought we would be playing cricket in any form in the States. But now it’s a reality. And that tells you about the growing impact of the sport in the world and the United States is more than willing to accept the change and be probably the first ones on a global scale to accept it, in a way, with the World Cup," Kohli said in a video message.
